# Blog 1: Motivating a Point 

As we have discussed, data visualization is often useful for motivating a point. Particularly, data visualization can be a succinct way of showing people why some question of scientific or journalistic inquiry matters. 

This short form blog will address some *political* question in which you might be interested. As we talked about, political data does not always have to be about *politics*, nor does it have to be a topic addressed in mainstream political science. So, you can absolutely think broadly about the politics in your own lives or the politics that influence your own interests. I will provide a list of potential datasets that will be useful, but if you have any data source in mind already or have questions about what constitutes a good political or social question, please consult with me. 

You should write as if you are pitching something to a popular outlet. Imagine you want to write an expos√© or some long-form journalism story for a major outlet, but you need to provide some documentation that what you want to write about is indeed worth the time. Therefore, this should not be written as an academic report, nor should it be written as some sensationalized rant about the point you want to make. Rather, you should write a succinct, honest memo of about 1,200 to 1,500 words plus 4 original visualizations to show that data out there confirms the importance and validity of your question (and potential hypothesis/solution) for a wide audience. I will not be *incredibly keen or critical* of minor grammar issues, so long a you provide a thoughtful and interesting commentary between your question and the data.  

Use the word count wisely! Begin the memo by conveying the problem that you are interested in, including some news relevant information (~250). You should expect to write a bit about the source of your data and why it's trustworthy, as well as any limitations (~150-200 words). The remainder of the text should address the question you are posing and how the data illustrates the importance of the question (~800-1,000). Talk about how you used the data, how we should interpret the visualizations and the measurements used, and any limitations of the visualizations you chose (e.g. if you had the opportunity to gather more data, what would you get?). Nest your visualizations within the text so the body flows like a typical blog post. 

You do not need to make extensive reference to political science academic work unless it is actually relevant. You should provide hyperlinked citations on your personal blog, as well as a bibliography at the end of the text. Remember to provide a citation for your dataset and any additional R packages that you use. Additionally, you should incorporate alt-text to accompany your visualizations. This is easy to do in Github or Markdown formats, [check out this link.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 

## Grading Criteria: 

1) The blog identifies an interesting political question and identifies a relevant data source to explore the question (+3)

2) The blog includes 4 + original visualizations that are meaningful toward the question posed by the author. (+7.5)

3) The author makes a reasonable effort to identify the limitations of the data and their visualizations toward the exploration of the question at hand. (+3)

4) The blog adopts the proper tone identified in the assignment description (+1.5)
