# Expectations for Peer Review

## General Norms for Engaging in the Peer Review Process 
1. Be kind and thoughtful. You are providing a responses that is supposed to help *improve* your peer's work, not *belittle* it. 

2. A full critique evaluates the *good* too. Always ensure that you are providing commentary on the well-executed elements of your peer's work too.

3. Provide constructive criticism that is in *good faith*. That is, provide critiques on elements that your peer can reasonably improve upon within the scope of the class, the data available, and to their reasonable ability. 

4. Be succinct in your comments, but carefully explain your evaluation-- comments such as "this is good, that was bad" aren't sufficiently helpful.

5. Your commentary may be most helpful if you include some suggestions or examples of *how* your peer might improve their work. You are encouraged to provide these suggestions, with the respect that your peer does *not* have to incorporate them if they disagree or feel the changes are not incorporable. 

## Requirements for Peer Relationship 

- Partners will be assigned by the second class session, during which time partners will meet and set an agreed upon means of communication. 
- Partners should communicate outside of class to document their expectations regarding: 
  - Communication Boundaries 
  - Expected Work Sharing-- How far in advance do you want to share drafts with one another? What is the expected turnaround? 
  - Modification to Criteria 
  - Assessment of relative strength that may particularly guide commentary (e.g. relative experience in R, desire to work on public writing, etc.)
