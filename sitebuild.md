# Site Build- 10 pts.

In this assignment, you will need to submit your initial site build for your blog. 

At a minumum, your site should include the scaffolding for the following elements: 

1. A site name 

2. A Welcome Page explaining the purpose of the site and a bit about who you are (can be minimal about you, or you can make things up, just write it well!) 

3. Additional tabs for each of the Visualization Blogs, the Short Form Blogs, and the Final Assignment-- No need to add text on these for now. 

To submit this assignment, you will simply submit the URL associated with your site on the course Canvas page. 

As a reminder you can use any of the following platforms to create your site: 

1) Own GitHub repository.
  - In this instance, you should hyperlink your different posts on the main README.md. You can do this by including the following markdown code: `[text](url or file path)`
 
2) [WordPress.org](wordpress.org) 

3) [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)
