## Visualization Blog 1: Just the Basics 

### Theme: CONTROVERSY!!! CONTENTION!!! 

This week's visualization asks you to do three things, all following a similar theme in politics and a similar practice in data viz. 

The thematic content of this week will be on controversial and contentious topics. So, the visualizations you find and create should be about controversial or contentious politics. This could be about abortion, student debt relief, violence, etc. 

This week we are going over *just the basics* of data viz, so whatever visualizations you come up with shouldn't be too intense or too information-packed. In fact, these visualizations should be basic enough that you should be able to reproduce them with your own code (more or less) if you have the data or the numbers. 

1) Find an existing visualization that you *really* like about a controversial or contentious topic. This could be a particularly informative and honest graphic or visual about a controversial topic that addresses basic information well. In your post, include a few sentences about what it is that you like or something that inspires you for your own visualization practices. Include a couple of lines of code that you think would produce a similar graphic. 

2) Find an existing visualization that you *really* dislike about a controversial or contentious topic-- the controversial topic does not have to be the same as in task (1). Include a sentence or two of critique, as well as suggestions as to what would make the viz better if the data were available. 

3) Create your own visualization(s) about a controversial or contentious topic (construed broadly) using data that you have found. You don't have to come up with anything incredibly original, just show you have a basic handle on the conceptual and technical material we have learned so far. Try to include up to *three* variables, however that may be. Contextualize the visualization, succinctly, to try to give an idea to readers what you did to the data to create that visualization.
