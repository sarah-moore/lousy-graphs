# Afrobarometer

[Afrobarometer](https://www.afrobarometer.org/) is a regional public opinion research network that conducts attitudinal surveys across the African continent related to democracy, governance, economy and society. Nationally representative surveys related to the project were first carried out in 1999 and have been rolled out on a 2- to 3-year basis since in 35 African countries. 

Given that the data are related to public opinion, the observations are at the individual level. 


**How are the data collected?** 

In person surveys are conducted among 1,200 to 2,400 adult citizens in each country of interest. In each participating country, a local research outlet develops the sampling and questionnaire protocols in local primary languages. In each country, the survey samples are proportionally stratigied across regions, or other subnational territories and urban versus rural areas. In each stratum, any adult citizen is equally likely to be asked to participate in the survey. 

Like other major public opinion data projects, data are available to be analyzed and engaged with on the Afrobarometer data platform prior to dowload. Futhermore, Afrobarometer has a list of [publications, reports, and working papers](https://www.afrobarometer.org/publications/) that have used Afrobarometer data in their analyses.
