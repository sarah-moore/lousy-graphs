## Moving to the next element of the tidyverse: `ggplot2` 
Last week we discussed `dplyr`, and unbeknownst to all of you we also used `readr` and maybe a couple other parts of `tidyverse` that are all just standard now. 

Today we're not going to *ditch* `dplyr` and all that entirely, but we will shift gears a bit so that we can get to `ggplot2`. Later this week we'll figure out how to use the two together. 

## load `tidyverse` 

```{r}
#|eecho: true 
# load tidyverse 
library(tidyverse)

# check to see that ggplot2 is included in the list of available tidyverse packages 
#tidyverse_packages()
```
