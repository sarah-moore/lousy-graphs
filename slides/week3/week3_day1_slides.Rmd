## What do we know *already?* 

- How can we think through mapping out what we already know about data analysis and graphics and how that translates into a "theory" of data viz? 

- We can even get into thinking technically along the lines of probability and statistical distributions (i.e. in terms of random variables). 

- Should also think through what *unit of analysis* our data are in and how we might have to transform that. 

## Let's try to dissect these:

What are the *variables* displayed?

## Tables are also a form of data viz, why not use them? 

## Why does this matter? 

- Some graphics packages in other more viz forward platforms make it incredibly easy to just point and click through what you want to put together in a graphic. (With limitations!!!)

- `ggplot2` requires that we think a little more carefully about what we put together. Because of the way that our code layers... But this is for the better. 

## Anatomy of a `ggplot2` call 
\small 
- Any visualization starting out in `ggplot2` mirrors the same way we were thinking of `dplyr`. Our data are the base. \centering

## Codetalk 

Additive code create exactly what we want our graph to be. It's called *declarative design*. 

```{r, eval=F}

some_data %>% # feed in the data 
  ggplot(aes(x = x_var, y = y_var)) + 
  # make the initial aesthetic spec 
  geom_function() + 
  # specify the geometric design 
  facet_wrap(~z_var) 
# optional specification of a facet 
  
#... and so on 
```

## Now let's make this concrete.
