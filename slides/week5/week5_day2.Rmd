# So far... 

We have established some of the following *loose* guidelines. 

# Our visualizations are based on the *kind* of data we have 

1) Continuous data (AKA quantitative data, numerical data)-- to reiterate this is data that has a "natural" numerical form or measurement. 

```{r, eval = T, message=F, warning=F, echo=T}
bigfoot$dew_point[1:45]
```


# Our visualizations are based on the *kind* of data we have 

2) Categorical data (AKA qualitative data), we might also call this discrete data in some cases, this data does not *necessarily* have a natural, direct numerical form or measurement. The exception to this is integer counts-- wherein we have a direct integer form but we can't have like half a count (e.g. number of siblings). 

```{r, eval = T, message=F, warning=F, echo=T}
bigfoot$season[1:45]
```



# We can further constrained by the way that we package that data

# And from that point we can choose to include more information. 

Potential additions, usually on the basis of categorical variables OR for clarity's sake: 

- Position:

  - Jitter
  
  - Grouping 
  
  - Faceting/Multiples 
  
  - Compound 

- Color (either outline color or fill)

  - Discrete color 
  
  - Gradient color 

- Shape 

- Transparency (either to make it easier to see density of data *or* as a function of another variable)


# And we'll get to more later to account for...

- Uncertainty and statistics

- Atypical coordinate systems 

# Beyond that...

We have a couple of style guidelines we have established: 

- Principle of proportional ink-- **the size of the ink representing data points need to be *proportional* to the data values they represent**.
  
  - Scales, data coverage, etc. 
  
- Color and shapes for: 

  - Distinguishing groups (categorical)

  - Represent data values (continuous)

  - Highlighting information 
  
# Hazards 

- Color and shape have limits. So, **RULE OF THUMB**: Qualitative color scales best for 3-5 categories, maybe less if we have some other transformations. 

- Choose interpretation over ultimate aesthetic vibes. 

- Provide ALT text when appropriate (i.e. a text caption in addition to your )


# Getting fancy? 

- Now we have also added some more swanky elements, like high level customization with `theme()` settings. 

- Also, `gganimate()`. 


# Anything else? 

# Now what does all of this assume so far? 

- A lot of what we have done so far kind of assumes that we have data that is already packaged as we want or need it. Or, I have just brushed over the code so that we can get where we want to go. 

- We have worked through some ways to transform your data from one type to another (i.e. `melt()` or `pivot.wider()`), but this doesn't necessarily transform individual variables into summary points that we can plot. 

- Nor do we have guidance on *what* sorts of summaries are decent, other than raw counts or proportions.
